# EE Experiments

- In each directory, `main.ipynb` is the notebook to start experiments on instances of Google Colaboratory with, and `summary.ipynb` is the notebook for processing the graphs
  - All the data is stored in `data/`
  - All the Python codes are stored in `src/`
  
- Some reference materials are stored in `/references/`

- For monitoring the experiments, a library called Hyperdash was used. In order to use the codes, the API key must be provided in `config.json` as the following:

  ```json
  {
    "hyperdash": {
      "api_key": "YOUR API KEY"
    }
  }
  ```
